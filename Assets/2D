2D:
Project setup: Change meta files, change git ignore, change render settings
Editor settings: version control mode: visible meta files, Asset Serialization Mode: Force text
GetButton: whether the key is pressed or not
GetButtonDown: is only true on the first frame when the button is pressed
GetButtonUp: is only true on the first frame when hte button is released

GetAxis: Returns a float between -1, and 1
Gravity: how fast the float value returns to zero (higher gravity would be like a slingshot)
Sensitivity: how fast the float value reaches one
Dead: dead zone for actual joysticks
Snap: return to zero is both axis are pressed
GetAxisRaw: returns an integer value (good for accuracy in 2D games)

OnMouseDown: Can detect a click on a collider

[RequireComponent(typeof(NameOfScript))]

Time.deltaTime : the time between each update call (makes movement per second rather than per update)

Vector2/3 : v.normalized * speed * Time.deltaTime;

rigidbody.MovePosition(transform.position + movement);


Physics.Raycast (ray, ...) will return true if the raycast has hit something
out hit : using the keyword out to get information 'out of' the hit variable
Ray Casting:
Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointRoRay(Input.mousePosition);
RaycashHit hit;

if (Physics.Raycast (ray, out hit, length, layerMask))
{
	
}
