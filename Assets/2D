GetButtonUp: is only true on the first frame when hte button is released

GetAxis: Returns a float between -1, and 1
Gravity: how fast the float value returns to zero (higher gravity would be like a slingshot)
Sensitivity: how fast the float value reaches one
Dead: dead zone for actual joysticks
Snap: return to zero is both axis are pressed
GetAxisRaw: returns an integer value (good for accuracy in 2D games)

OnMouseDown: Can detect a click on a collider
